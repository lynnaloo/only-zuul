# Only Zuul

Using good development practices and eliminating current and potential bugs is a little like ghostbusting. 

## What this is

>I am the Keymaster ... Are you the Gatekeeper?

This repository illustrates a sample Node.js repository with static code analysis, standardized formatting, and CI/CD pipelines (to multiple cloud platforms) using Github Actions.

## Setup

See the `README.md` in each service for more instructions for that FaaS environment.

# Install

Install [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/) 

Clone this repository

```
$ git clone git@github.com:lynnaloo/only-zuul.git
$ cd only-zuul
```

Choose a cloud platform, install libraries, deploy, and run!

```
$ cd [your-favorite-ghostbuster]
$ npm install
```

Since these are HTTP services, you can execute them like a REST API

```
http://{generated cloud platform url}/
```
